            Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape to develop a new scripting
            language for this purpose. The language was initially called Mocha
            and later changed to LiveScript. In December 1995, LiveScript was
            renamed JavaScript, partly to capitalize on the growing popularity
            of the programming language Java. It was designed to be lightweight,
            interpreted, and primarily used for client-side scripting to
            manipulate web page elements in real-time.

            ES4: The planned fourth edition was intended to be a massive
            overhaul, adding ambitious features like classes and modules.
            However, it was ultimately abandoned due to political disagreements
            over language complexity between Microsoft and the rest of the
            committee.

            It brought modern features and syntax that transformed the language:
            Classes: A new syntax for creating objects and managing inheritance.
            Arrow Functions: A shorter syntax for writing function expressions.
            let and const: Block-scoped variable declarations. Promises: A
            standard way to handle asynchronous operations. Modules: Native
            import and export support for code organization.
